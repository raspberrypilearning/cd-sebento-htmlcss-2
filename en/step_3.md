## Getting set up

+ Go to the starter trinket project at [dojo.soy/html2-website-start](http://dojo.soy/html2-website-start){:target="_blank"}. The examples in these Sushi Cards are mainly based on this project. 

+ If you prefer, you can work with a website that you already made.

- Click the **Remix** button in the top right-hand corner of the project (if you are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so. Once you've signed in, you will then need to click the **Remix** button again). This creates a copy of the project for you to work with.

It should say **remixed** after you click it:

Even if you don't have an account, you can still work with Trinket.

### Saving your work
You can save your work by using one of the options in the **Share** menu. You can either download the project or get a link that you can save, for example in a document, or send via email.
**Note**: each time you make a change to the project, you will get a new link.

### How to sign up for an account
If you want to create an account on Trinket, follow the steps below. This will allow you to access your work easily from any computer, and to **remix** projects somebody else has shared with you (meaning save a copy to which you can make changes).

- In browser tab with the starter trinket project, click **Sign Up For Your Free Account**. You will need an email address to sign up. 

- Enter your email address and choose a password, or ask somebody to do this for you.

- You can now access all your saved or remixed projects by clicking on your username and going to **My Trinkets**.
